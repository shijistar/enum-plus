              - If you added a new feature, please add unit tests and ensure 100% code coverage. If an exception is thrown, please also add tests to cover this exception case
              - If you think your changes should appear in the changelog, please update it accordingly. For unreleased versions, we can add an [Unreleased] section at top
              - Don't hesitate to ask questions if something is unclear
