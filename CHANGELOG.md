## 2.3.4

2025-7-2

### Features

- ✨ Enhance the type definitions for methods like `Enum.label`, `Enum.key`, and `Enum.raw` to ensure return types more accurately correspond to input values. When an input value can be matched within the enum, the return type will no longer include `undefined`.

## 2.3.3

2025-6-19

### Features

- 🔥 Allow naming Enum types, accept both plain text and localization keys, similar to the localization for enum members.
- 🛠 Mark Enum collection fields as `readonly`.

## 2.3.2

2025-6-10

## 2.3.1

2025-6-7

## 2.3.0

2025-5-23

### Features

- ✨ Export new symbols `ENUM_ITEM`，`ENUM_ITEMS` and `ENUM_COLLECTION` which are used to access some special internal properties.
- ✨ Add `[ENUM_COLLECTION]: true` to the `Enum` class, which is used to indicates that this is as an enum collection.
- ✨ Add `[ENUM_ITEM]: true` to the `EnumItem` class, which is used to indicates that this is as an enum item.
- ✨ Add `[ENUM_ITEMS]: true` to `Enum.items` array, which is used to indicates that this is as an enum items array.

### Notable Changes

- 💣 Remove `[Symbol.toStringTag]: "EnumItem"` from `EnumItem` class. The result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(enumItem)` is changed from `[object EnumItem]` back to `[object Object]`. If you are relying on this, please use `enumItem[ENUM_ITEM] === true` instead.
- 💣 Remove `[Symbol.toStringTag]: "EnumCollection"` from `Enum` class. The result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(enum)` is changed from `[object EnumCollection]` to `[object Array]`. If you are relying on this, please use `enum[ENUM_COLLECTION] === true` instead.

## 2.2.11
