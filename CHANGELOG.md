# enum-plus Changelog

## 3.0.0

_UNRELEASED_

**enum-plus v3** is coming! 🎉

### Features

- 🔥 add `Enum.install` method which introduces a new plugin system. The plugin system allows you to add new methods or properties to all enums. While similar to `Enum.extends`, the plugin system enables features to be packaged as `shareable` plugins, making it more flexible and widely applicable.
- 🔥 introduce an official plugin `enum-plus-plugin` that provides a collection of highly shareable plugins.
  - These plugins are designed to work in all scenarios and environments (including browser and Node.js), without introducing dependencies on third-party frameworks, component libraries, or platforms.
  - If you have a good idea that might be specific to a certain framework or platform rather than universally applicable, we recommend creating a new plugin project (e.g., `enum-plus-plugin-xxx`). We are happy to see that, and hope that you submit a PR to `enum-plus-plugin` to link your project back.
- ✨ Includes the `UMD` module format in this release, which allows you to use `enum-plus` in a browser environment without the need for a module bundler. This is particularly useful for quick prototyping or when working with legacy codebases that do not support modern module systems. You can find them in the `umd` directory of the package. They can also be downloaded in [github release](https://github.com/shijistar/enum-plus/releases) assets.

### Breaking Changes

- 💣 the following deprecated methods are removed:
  - `enums.values`
  - `enums.options`
  - `enums.menus`
  - `enums.filters`
  - `enums.valuesEnum`
- Please use the new methods `Enum.items`, `Enum.toSelect`, `Enum.toMenu`, `Enum.toFilter`, and `Enum.toValueMap` instead, which are introduced since `v2.1.0`.

## 2.4.2

2025-7-8

### Bug Fixes

- 🐞 Fix the issue where `lib/extension.d.ts` was missing, which caused all enum types to default to `any`.

## 2.4.1

> ⚠️ This version is deprecated. Please use `v2.4.2` instead.

2025-7-7

### Bug Fixes

- 🐞 Fix `lib/extension.d.ts` missing issue, but failed. Please use `v2.4.2` instead.

2025-7-6

### Features

- 🛠 Support `Node.js ESM`
- 🛠 Remove file circular dependencies

## 2.3.5

2025-7-6

### Features

- 🛠 Downgrade the requirement of TypeScript to `v3.8`

## 2.3.4

2025-7-2

### Features

- ✨ Enhance the type definitions for methods like `Enum.label`, `Enum.key`, and `Enum.raw` to ensure return types more accurately correspond to input values. When an input value can be matched within the enum, the return type will no longer include `undefined`.

## 2.3.3

2025-6-19

### Features

- 🔥 Allow naming Enum types, accept both plain text and localization keys, similar to the localization for enum members.
- 🛠 Mark Enum collection fields as `readonly`.
- 🛠 Improve the type of `Enum.label`、`Enum.key`、`Enum.raw` parameters, to accept the real value types.

## 2.3.2

2025-6-10

### Features

- ✨ Improve type IntelliSense for array initialization Enums, allowing enum items to be listed as literals. Thanks to @mudoo.

## 2.3.1

2025-6-7

### Features

- ✨ Add `IEnum` to packages exports

## 2.3.0

2025-5-23

### Features

- ✨ Export new symbols `ENUM_ITEM`，`ENUM_ITEMS` and `ENUM_COLLECTION` which are used to access some special internal properties.
- ✨ Add `[ENUM_COLLECTION]: true` to the `Enum` class, which is used to indicates that this is as an enum collection.
- ✨ Add `[ENUM_ITEM]: true` to the `EnumItem` class, which is used to indicates that this is as an enum item.
- ✨ Add `[ENUM_ITEMS]: true` to `Enum.items` array, which is used to indicates that this is as an enum items array.

### Notable Changes

- 💣 Remove `[Symbol.toStringTag]: "EnumItem"` from `EnumItem` class. The result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(enumItem)` is changed from `[object EnumItem]` back to `[object Object]`. If you are relying on this, please use `enumItem[ENUM_ITEM] === true` instead.
- 💣 Remove `[Symbol.toStringTag]: "EnumCollection"` from `Enum` class. The result of `Object.prototype.toString.call(enum)` is changed from `[object EnumCollection]` to `[object Array]`. If you are relying on this, please use `enum[ENUM_COLLECTION] === true` instead.

## 2.2.11

2025-5-15

### Features

- 🛠 Remove `"type": "commonjs"` from package.json, which may breaks webpack bundling.

## 2.2.10

2025-5-14

### Features

- ✨ Enhance the type inference of the `raw` method. When the input value matches a specific enum item, it only returns the raw object of that enum item instead of returning the raw objects of all enum items.

## 2.2.9

2025-4-20

### Features

- 🛠 Emit a warning while trying to modify an `EnumItem`

### Bug Fixes

- 🐞 the output `lib` directory structure is incorrect. This will break legacy Node.js applications using the `CommonJS` module spec, while modern Node.js applications using the `NodeNext` module spec remain unaffected. This issue was introduced in `v2.2.7`. For node.js applications, it's strongly recommended to upgrade.
